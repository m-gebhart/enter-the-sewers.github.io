		<p>Well done, recruit. You have discovered the entrance. The pipe that leads into the sewers. A strange world lies down below, invisible to the ignorant. With our help, you may find it.</p>
		<p>We are the <b>Rats</b>, chasers of the exceptional. The underground system of Berlin is our hunting ground. In the tunnels and hallways, strange things take their course. We examine what the commoners dispatch as curiosities, delusions, and myths. To them, we are no more than rebellious members of the local graffiti scene.</p>
		<p>You, however, have proven yourself different. You spot things commoners overlook. You see patterns where they declare chaos. Otherwise, you would not be here. We have been looking for someone like you.</p>
		<p>Be aware though, potential is only one side of the coin. Will is the other. Do you have what it takes to become a <b>Rat</b>? Your initiation trial will give us the answer. We have some cases for you. Solve them to our satisfaction and your admission will be granted.</p>
		<p>The first test is about to begin. It will lead you to a station abounding in history. <font color="#FFD700">Potsdamer Platz</font> is where your journey commences.</p>
		<p>A word of warning before you strike out: We value our privacy. Do not show this website in public. Do not talk about your initiation with your friends or family. Do not mention the <b>Rats</b> to anyone. If somebody still asks questions, you know what we are - graffiti artists. The only thing we care about is a filled spray can and a blank wall to decorate.</p>
		<p>Go now. Complete the trial. <i>She</i> has high hopes for you. Do not disappoint us, recruit. Do not disappoint <i>her</i>.</p>
