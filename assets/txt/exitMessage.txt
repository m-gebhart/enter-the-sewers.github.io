<pre><font color="#FFD800">You have earned our deepest thanks, recruit. Due to your contribution, we have been spared from what could have become a serious catastrophe for our organization. Do not worry about the pathetic <b>'Rat-Catcher'</b> and his furry companion. We will take care of them immediately and put an end to this nasty matter for good.<br></pre>
<pre>Apparently, <i>Ms. Lymsbery</i> has been right about you all along. You have passed all of our tests with flying colors. Well, it should not be a surprise. She is rarely mistaken.<br></pre>
<pre>You have demonstrated that you are ready to become one of us, recruit: With empathy and disguise, you gained <font color="#FFFFFF">Sophie von Tscharner's</font> trust and solved the mystery surrounding her song. The story of <font color="#FFFFFF">Michael and Hermann Kleist</font> taught you to draw connections between what seems to be unrelated events. Hopefully, you have learned by now that unlikely does not mean impossible. Last but not least, you helped take down our foes and exhibited an ability to bring order to chaos.<br></pre>
<pre>It is time we drop the 'recruit'. You are a <b>Rat</b> now, one of us. With every ascent comes new responsibility, but let this be the topic for another time. We have something for you:</pre>
<pre><a target="_blank" style="color: white" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="assets/images/poster.png"">A New Rat Rises in the Sewers</a><br></pre>
<pre>Do not be mistaken, it is much more than a simple reward. It is proof of your newly-acquired status, a way to recognize people of our kin, and a key that will open more doors than you can imagine right now.<br></pre>
<pre>This is it. I am sure we will meet one day. Until then, keep your body alert and your mind open, <b>Rat</b>. You will hear from us.<br></pre>
<pre><b>PS:</b> On a more personal note, you are one of the first recruits who took part in our online initiation test. We hope you will not be the last and so we are constantly looking for ways to improve it. <a target="_blank" style="color: white" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://forms.gle/d7C2A4R7K6PJUjNn8">You could do all of us a favor and tell us about your experience.</a> Take it as your first duty as a <b>Rat</b>.</font></pre>
