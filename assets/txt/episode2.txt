<font color="#FFFFFF">Well done with the initial test. But you seem to have spent enough time with Sophie. Now, for a real challenge:<br><br>
There appears to be something amiss with the legendary <font color="#FFD800">Alexanderplatz</font>. We have heard rumours that the paintings around there have been radiating a strange energy. It seems something is off with them. But of course, these could just be the ramblings of a couple of drunks.<br><br>
However, a simple kiosk owner who seems to have stumbled upon a most mysterious encounter with a rather unique gentleman. He dresses strange and talks funny. Our recruits however cannot seem to find anything about him and have failed at even a simple tailing mission. It is up to you now.<br><br>
The kiosk owner on the other hand, seems to be a rather talkative fellow. And a little mouse tells us that he has his own blog website, where he reveals even more details about his already public life. It seems he wants people to know everything about him. Well that makes our job really easy.<br><br>
Look through his posts and find the secrets that lie just out of reach and under the surface. The signs that lesser men look past. Who is this mysterious gentleman? Find out his full name so we can find out more about him from our archives. Remember recruit, the proving grounds are open and all we care for, are results.<br><br>
No matter what you do, your first priority is protecting the secrecy of our organization. Any behavior that threatens our mission will not be tolerated. We will keep more than an eye on you.<br><br>
