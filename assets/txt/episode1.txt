Members of our organization have witnessed remarkable events around <font color="#FFD800">Potsdamer Platz</font>. A young girl is playing music on the streets near the underground station. The same song every day. Over and over. Nothing changes and still, her audience is shrinking every day.<br><br>
That aside, we got a glimpse of her guitar case. Not a single cent was in there, yet it was not empty. According to the report, it looked like a collection of shabby books was stuffed inside.<br><br>
We suspect is has to do with her song. Something is hidden in it. <i>Find out what it is</i>. This will be your first task. You are not alone, we look out for one another.<br><br>
A group of tech-savvy <b>Rats</b> recently managed to hack a mobile phone. It belongs to the girl's best friend. You will be able to read old messages and even write her yourself. <i>Gain her trust and find out about the song</i>. Then come back here and let us know what you found.<br><br>
No matter what you do, your first priority is protecting the secrecy of our organization. Any behavior that threatens our mission will not be tolerated. We will keep more than an eye on you.<br><br>
