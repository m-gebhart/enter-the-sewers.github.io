<font color="#FFFFFF">Brilliant. Only a handful of recruits have uncovered the mystery of Hermann's ghost and each one of them took far longer. You seem to be one of our most promising recruits yet. However, the final challenge begins now:<br><br>
We have a person of interest we'd like you to investigate. It all started around <font color="#FFD800">Rathaus Neuk&ouml;lln</font>, when one of our sleeper agents reported an odd man following our graffiti signs and asking questions. After examining his online persona, we found that this individual goes by the name <b>'The Rat-Catcher.'</b> He dares to call himself our antagonist and seems to be actively hunting us down.<br><br>
But this <b>'The Rat-Catcher'</b> seems to be more dangerous than we initially assumed. At the start we classified him as a minor inconvenience. But now it seems that he is not working alone. He has had some external help and if Agent Jacky is to be believed, then it's from a cat. <b>A Talking Cat.</b> Either she has lost her mind, or we have stumbled upon something truly exhilarating.<br><br>
Our scouts have collected a ton of data on this individual. Locations, conversation transcripts and more. But, no one seems to be able to make sense of it all. I hate to admit, but it seems to have put our organization into chaos. Forgotten passwords, corrupted files and even our prized agent Jacky Bauer, who was working on the report, has gone missing.<br><br>
You shall be granted access to Jacky's personal cloud storage space. All the data necessary to find <b>'The Rat-Catcher'</b> should be present or so she said, in her last message. <i>Follow the trail and find out where we can find him and his filthy feline.</i> We hope you can make sense of this data, where all before you have failed. All we need is a <i>reliable location</i> and we shall take good care of them. Do this and you can finally be one of us.<br><br>
No matter what you do, your first priority is protecting the secrecy of our organization. Any behavior that threatens our mission will not be tolerated. We will keep more than an eye on you.<br><br>
